# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

The project can be run by putting your own inputs in an `inputs` folder. They
should be ordered, so calling them `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`, etc.. Should suffice.

```
# Day 1
[TIMING] 'day1#parse' took: 52.299µs
[TIMING] 'day1#1' took: 36.479µs
[TIMING] 'day1#2' took: 29.005µs

# Day 2
TBD
```
